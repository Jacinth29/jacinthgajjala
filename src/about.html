            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Prior to this role, I spent nearly nine years in the legal technology space, starting as a Support Engineer, progressing to Senior Support Engineer, and eventually moving into a Technical Consultant role. This progression shaped how I approach systems — from deeply understanding edge cases and customer pain points to designing reliable, scalable solutions.</p>
         <p>I’m currently focused on expanding into agentic AI and LLM-based systems, exploring how autonomous and semi-autonomous agents can collaborate to support decision-making, orchestration, and human-in-the-loop workflows.</p>
         <p>In 2025, I relocated to Atlanta after spending 11 years in Chicago. Outside of work and learning, I enjoy exploring the city with my dog and building small experimental projects that turn ideas into working systems.</p>
