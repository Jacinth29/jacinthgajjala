            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>
                I’m Jacinth, an Integration Engineer at Vesta, a fraud detection and payment
                processing company. I work on complex API integrations, secure transaction
                flows, and cross-functional problem solving across product, engineering,
                and customer teams.
            </p>

            <p>
                Prior to this role, I spent nearly nine years in the legal technology space,
                starting as a Support Engineer, progressing to Senior Support Engineer,
                and eventually moving into a Technical Consultant role. This progression
                shaped how I approach systems — from deeply understanding edge cases and
                customer pain points to designing reliable, scalable solutions.
            </p>

            <p>
                I’m currently focused on expanding into agentic AI and LLM-based systems,
                exploring how autonomous and semi-autonomous agents can collaborate to
                support decision-making, orchestration, and human-in-the-loop workflows.
            </p>

            <p>
                In 2025, I relocated to Atlanta after spending 11 years in Chicago. Outside
                of work and learning, I enjoy exploring the city with my dog and building
                small experimental projects that turn ideas into working systems.
